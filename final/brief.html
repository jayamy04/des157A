    <h1>Project Brief</h1>
    <h2>By Amy Lee</h2>
    <article>
        <p><b>Project Summary</b> I will be updating the Game On! project on areas visual design (major) and functionality (minor).</p>
        <p><b>Project Description</b> I plan to build on the space pigs theme in the project. I would be adding more plants and assets in the space background and more pig characters exploring facial expressions. As for the functionality, I will be adding the game slot feature where the numbers where they will move vertically in order and act like a game slot machine. This will be a challenge for sure, but I can probably figure it out with a lot of debugging and fully understanding how the game code works. I will probably add a feature where you can play around with the pig's tails like click and drag and stretch it out. Both changes will be pretty major, and should be pretty challenging, but I know I will be having fun with all of that.</p>
        <p><b>Expert Feedback</b>I will be sharing it to the teaching team and a developer I know who has interned at a tech company over the summer.</p>
