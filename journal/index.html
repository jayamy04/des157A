            I completely agree with the article, although some parts really go in detail about what is good or not. I would say from my previous experiences that what is most important point in this article is putting the easiest prompts first like name, email, and year, then the questions that require long answers go in the very end. Then, people usually fill out the beginning and start filling out the long-answers, they have already "commited," and they are more likely to come back and fill out the rest of the form. Another important point made was making the required fields as clear as possible, because sometimes I submit the form to see if I filled out all the forms so it tells me after I submit if I missed anything, but this is such a hassle and I am afraid that all the information will be deleted after submitting.

        I like that for a lot of student organizations, they make the "critical thinking" questions optional, but still includes it so if anyone has any thoughts they want to share with the club, they can. This fosters a welcoming environment. Also, they usually ask for the name, year, and email first before getting into the actual content that requires some decision making.
